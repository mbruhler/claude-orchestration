name: "Reddit Startup Idea Analyzer"
description: |
  Automated market validation workflow that discovers and analyzes startup ideas from Reddit.
  This template fetches trending posts from startup-related subreddits, performs comprehensive
  competition research in parallel batches, and generates a multi-factor rating system to identify
  the most promising opportunities.

  The workflow integrates Reddit's API via PRAW to collect ideas, uses temporary Python scripts
  for web scraping and patent searches, and employs a human-in-the-loop review process with
  automatic refetch capabilities when ideas are rejected. Each idea is scored across six dimensions:
  Overall potential, Competition level, Implementation complexity, Market size, Monetization
  potential, and Feasibility.

  Perfect for entrepreneurs, product managers, and investors seeking validated startup opportunities
  with low competition and high market potential. The parallel batch processing enables efficient
  analysis of multiple ideas simultaneously while maintaining thorough research depth.

# Reddit Startup Idea Analyzer Template

## Overview

This workflow template automates the discovery and validation of startup ideas from Reddit. It combines API integration, parallel processing, and human review to identify high-potential opportunities with minimal competition.

## Prerequisites

### Reddit API Credentials
1. Visit https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
3. Select "script" as the app type
4. Note your `client_id` (under app name) and `client_secret`

### Python Dependencies
The workflow automatically creates temp scripts that require:
- `praw` - Reddit API wrapper
- `requests` - HTTP library for web scraping
- `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing (optional, for advanced scraping)

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
/orchestration:template reddit-startup-analyzer
```

When prompted, provide:
- **REDDIT_CLIENT_ID**: Your Reddit app client ID
- **REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET**: Your Reddit app client secret
- **NUM_IDEAS** (optional): Number of ideas to fetch (default: 10)
- **SUBREDDITS** (optional): Comma-separated subreddit list (default: startup_ideas,SomebodyMakeThis,Entrepreneur,Business_Ideas)

### Custom Configuration Example
```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID: abc123xyz
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET: secret456def
NUM_IDEAS: 15
SUBREDDITS: startups,SaaS,indiebiz,buildinpublic
```

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Reddit Post Fetching
Creates and executes a Python script using PRAW to:
- Authenticate with Reddit API
- Fetch hot posts from specified subreddits
- Filter out meta posts, sticky posts, and announcements
- Extract title, description, URL, score, and metadata
- Return structured JSON array

### 2. Parallel Competition Analysis
Splits ideas into 5 parallel batches (2 ideas each) for concurrent analysis:
- **Google Search**: Check for existing solutions and competitors
- **Patent Search**: Identify potential IP conflicts
- **Domain Availability**: Check .com/.io/.app domains
- **ProductHunt/Competitors**: Find similar products in launch databases

Each batch runs independently via temporary Python scripts for maximum efficiency.

### 3. Rating Table Generation
Consolidates all research into a comprehensive markdown table with 6-factor scoring:
- **Overall Score** (1-10): Holistic opportunity assessment
- **Competition Level** (1-10): Inverse score (1=high competition, 10=blue ocean)
- **Complexity** (1-10): Implementation difficulty
- **Market Size** (1-10): Total addressable market estimate
- **Monetization** (1-10): Revenue generation potential
- **Feasibility** (1-10): Technical and resource viability

### 4. Manual Review Checkpoint
Presents the ratings table for human review. Options:
- Type "approve all" to accept all ideas and proceed
- List numbers to ban (e.g., "1, 3, 7") to trigger refetch
- Add comments for additional context

### 5. Conditional Refetch Loop
If ideas are rejected:
- Calculates number of banned ideas
- Fetches replacement posts from Reddit
- Excludes previously analyzed posts
- Re-runs competition analysis on new ideas
- Presents updated table for final review

### 6. Executive Summary
Generates final report with:
- Top 3 ranked opportunities with detailed rationale
- Market insights and trend analysis
- Strategic recommendations for validation
- Next steps for each opportunity

## Customization Options

### Modify Subreddit Sources
Edit the `$SUBREDDITS` variable to target specific communities:
```
$SUBREDDITS := "{{SUBREDDITS:SaaS,indiehackers,nocode,microsaas}}"
```

### Adjust Batch Size
For more/fewer ideas, modify `$NUM_IDEAS` and update parallel batch structure:
```
$NUM_IDEAS := "{{NUM_IDEAS:20}}"
```

Then add more parallel batches in Step 2.

### Enhanced Competition Research
Modify batch analysis prompts to include:
- LinkedIn company searches
- Crunchbase funding data
- GitHub repository analysis
- App store presence checks
- Social media sentiment analysis

### Custom Rating Criteria
Add domain-specific metrics to Step 3:
- Regulatory Compliance (1-10)
- Environmental Impact (1-10)
- Scalability Potential (1-10)
- Community Demand (1-10)

## Output Examples

### Ratings Table Format
```markdown
| # | Title | Description | Overall | Competition | Complexity | Market | Monetization | Feasibility | Competitors | Patent Risk | Domain |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|------------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | AI Resume Parser | Extract structured data from resumes | 8.5 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 3 medium competitors | Low | Available (.com, .io) |
| 2 | Local Service Marketplace | Connect homeowners with contractors | 6.0 | 3 | 8 | 8 | 7 | 6 | Thumbtack, TaskRabbit, Angi | Medium | Taken |
```

### Executive Summary Sample
```markdown
## Top 3 Startup Opportunities

### 1. AI Resume Parser (Score: 8.5/10)
**Why it's promising:**
- Large underserved market (HR tech growing 12% YoY)
- Moderate competition with differentiation opportunities
- Clear monetization via API/SaaS model
- Technical feasibility with modern NLP tools

**Next Steps:**
- Build MVP with GPT-4 integration
- Target ATS integration as go-to-market
- Validate with 10 HR managers interviews

```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Run during peak Reddit hours** (9 AM - 5 PM EST) for fresher content
2. **Combine multiple subreddits** for diverse idea sources
3. **Adjust NUM_IDEAS based on depth** (fewer = more thorough analysis)
4. **Save rejected ideas** - they may become relevant later
5. **Iterate on rating criteria** based on your investment thesis
6. **Export results** to spreadsheet for long-term tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Reddit API Rate Limits
- Default limit: 60 requests/minute
- Workflow uses ~1-2 requests per idea
- If exceeded: Reduce `$NUM_IDEAS` or add delays

### Script Execution Failures
- Ensure temp-scripts directory exists
- Check Python environment has required packages
- Verify API credentials are correct

### Empty Results
- Try different subreddits or time of day
- Lower filtering thresholds (allow lower scores)
- Expand search to "rising" or "new" posts

## Advanced Use Cases

### Niche Market Research
Target micro-communities for specialized opportunities:
```
$SUBREDDITS := "biohackers,quantifiedself,nootropics,longevity"
```

### Competitor Monitoring
Run weekly to track emerging competitors in your space:
```
$SUBREDDITS := "your_industry_subreddit"
$NUM_IDEAS := "5"
```

### Investment Pipeline
Use as deal flow source for angel investing or VC:
- Higher weight on Market Size and Monetization
- Add funding feasibility analysis
- Cross-reference with Crunchbase data
